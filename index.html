                John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, master of myth and language, wove together the vast tapestry of Middle-earth with a pen forged in imagination. His words gave rise to realms undreamt of, and his legacy continues to echo through the ages like the songs of Elves beneath the stars.

                In a quiet corner of the world, beneath the hills and beyond the rivers, lies the Shire. There began the tale of Bilbo Baggins, an unassuming hobbit whose courage stirred dragons, roused kingdoms, and proved that even the smallest hands can shape the fate of all.

                A fellowship formed in darkness, a ring born of fire. From Rivendell to Mordor, the journey of heroes carved legends into the very stone of Arda. In the shadow of Mount Doom, the will of the Free Peoples was tested—and their bravery burned brighter than any flame.

                Beyond the tales of Hobbits and Kings lie the ancient songs—of Beren and Lúthien, of the Silmarils, the children of Húrin and the fall of Númenor. These are the roots of Middle-earth, its sorrow and splendor, where light and shadow dance in eternal struggle and hope endures through legend.
